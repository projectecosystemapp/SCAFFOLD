# Security Policy

We take security seriously. Please follow responsible disclosure.

Do:
- Report vulnerabilities privately via GitHub Security Advisories (preferred) or the contact form at [specdriver.dev](https://specdriver.dev).
- Include steps to reproduce, impact, and any relevant logs or screenshots.
- Allow us reasonable time to investigate and address the issue before public disclosure.

Do not:
- Test against production in ways that could harm other users.
- Exfiltrate data, modify systems, or run destructive tests.

Scope:
- This repo hosts public docs and metadata. The hosted SCAFFOLD service is proprietary; please use private reports for anything involving the live product or infrastructure.

We will:
- Acknowledge reports promptly.
- Provide status updates during investigation.
- Credit researchers if desired after remediation (subject to consent).
